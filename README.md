# Genetic-Algo-Simulation

A visual 2D representation of the genetic algorithm in unity. It runs a simulation of a population that exists for a certain period in seconds as defined in the lifetime variable and evolves through generations towards the dominant blue gene considered as the choice of metric for the fitness.

## how to run the project
